Requirements:

install npm
intall dependencies using npm
install parcel using npm (large, so you may want to do this globally)
create apiKey.ts in src/ that defines apiKey (see src/apiKey.sample.ts)


Commands:

run dev server: npm run dev


Comments:

I've never actually used redux before, so this may not be the most elegant way to do things.

The api key thing is awkward as hell, but it works.  The "proper" way to do things would
involve making a server, and that seemed like overkill.
