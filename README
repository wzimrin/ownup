Comments:

I've never actually used redux before, so this may not be the most elegant way to do things.

The api key thing is awkward as hell, but it works.  The "proper" way to do things would
involve making a server, and that seemed like overkill.

The lack of testing is due to a mix of "I didn't have time to figure out how to test redux"
and "there is very little logic worth testing here".  store.ts/fetchQuotes has some stuff to
test, but for the rest, ts type checking will catch most errors.
